# Konoha
A public repo with some useful stuff. Almost everything is written in PaperSpigot here (1.9+). You cand find some interesting things here.

Maintained by Sasuke and GDD's members.

**Things you cand find here (yet):**
  - MongoDB
  - SQL
  - Packets and NMS stuff
  - A Scheduler Prototype

I know that's a really bad README, but I'll keep updating it.
